# Professional README Generator

## Badges

## Description

I really wanted an easy way to generate a README file because at the end of my projects the last thing I want to do is create a README file from scratch.

## Installation

When you enter into the
repository and bring up the code in VS Code, you will need to run the [npm i] command in order to install
the inquirer node module. Once the module is installed, then you can run the [node index.js] command and you
will begin the prompts for the generator.

## Usage

Once you run the [node index.js] command just go through each prompt and answer to the best of your ability. This should create a highly detailed and professional looking README.MD file.
